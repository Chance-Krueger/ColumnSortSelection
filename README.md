# ColumnSortSelection
## Description
This Java program reads integers from a file into a 2D matrix and sorts them using a combination of selection sort and column sort algorithms. It organizes data by repeatedly sorting columns and applying Leighton's parallel-inspired column sort to efficiently structure the matrix. The sorted output and matrix info and sorting time print to the console.

## What I learned: 
    - How to implement and combine sorting algorithms (selection sort and column sort) to organize data in a 2D matrix.
    - Handling file input and parsing integer data safely.
    - Structuring and manipulating data in multi-dimensional arrays.
    - Applying classic algorithm concepts like Leighton’s column sort in practice.
    - Balancing algorithmic simplicity and efficiency for structured data.
    - Writing clean, modular Java code that reads input, processes data, and outputs results.
    - Debugging and validating input to ensure program robustness.

## How To run it:
### Using Eclipse:
    - Create a new Java Project.
    - Add ColumnSortSelection.java to the src folder.
    - Save the file.
    - Right-click ColumnSortSelection.java → Select Run As → Java Application.
    - When prompted, enter the path to your input text file containing integers.

### Using Command Line:
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the folder containing ColumnSortSelection.java.
    
#### Compile the program:
        javac ColumnSortSelection.java

#### Run the program:
        java ColumnSortSelection

    - When prompted, type the full path or filename of the input file containing integers (one per line).

### Note:
    - The input file must have one integer per line.
    - If a non-integer value is found, the program will display an error and terminate.

## Future Improvements
    - Make it jar file
    - Optimize Sorting Algorithms
    - Dynamic Matrix Sizing
    - Enhanced Error Handling
    - Support for Different Data Types
    - Detailed Logging and Metrics
        - Add logging to record step-by-step sorting progress and performance metrics like time and memory usage for analysis.
        - Instead of just at the end.
