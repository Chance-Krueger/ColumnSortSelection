# ColumnSortSelection
This Java program reads integers from a file into a 2D matrix and sorts them using a combination of selection sort and column sort algorithms. It organizes data by repeatedly sorting columns and applying Leighton's parallel-inspired column sort to efficiently structure the matrix. The sorted output and matrix info print to the console.
